Overview;
This is a Ruby object oriented approach to build a web application that utilized SQLite to track user information and logins. 

Preface;
This is to help you test the code in Qwasar's DoCode Environment.
A database "called my_user_app" and "cookies.txt" will be created as you go.
also Gaetan Juvin assures me that "index.erb" is as valid as "index.html" 
 
Part 1
To test Part 1, you may wish to copy and paste 
"require 'sqlite3'" on line 7 alongside the entire User class into a seperate file.
That way sinatra a web server (which is used in parts 2 and 3) doesn't launch.
Add the following segments of code to test out the methods;

"inst = User.new
result = inst.create(user_info)#User info will be: firstname, lastname, age, password and email
print result"

"inst = User.new
result = inst.get(user_id)
print result"

"inst = User.new
result = inst.all
print result"

"inst = User.new
result = inst.update(user_id, attribute, value)
print result"

"inst = User.new
inst.destroy(user_id)
result = inst.all
print result"

Part 2
To test in the docode environment you will require 2 terminals. 
In the first terminal enter "ruby db.sql.rb" to start the server.
You can then enter the following curl commands seen further bellow.
Remember, that when using the "curl -X DELETE" command you have to manually delete
your own cookie files, which will be the "cookies.txt" file generated by the 
curl commands below.

curl -X POST localhost:8080/users -d "firstname=John" -d "lastname=Doe" -d "age=25" -d "email=jd@gmail.com" -d "password=amneaisa"

curl localhost:8080/users  

curl -X POST -c cookies.txt localhost:8080/sign_in -d "email=ac@gmail.com" -d "password=Chess"

[custome option I created that allows one to see their logged in status and retreived user Id]
curl -L -b cookies.txt localhost:8080/sign_in2  

[open my_user_app and scroll to the end[far-right] to find the entries]
curl -X PUT -b cookies.txt localhost:8080/users -d "attribute=password" -d "value=NewPassword"
[see how the data has changed]

curl -X DELETE -b cookies.txt localhost:8080/sign_out

curl -X DELETE -b cookies.txt localhost:8080/users
[look at my_user_app or enter "curl localhost:8080/users" to see that an entry was removed]


Part 3
CLARIFICATION: Gaetan Juvin assures me that "index.erb" is as valid as "index.html" 
with the server session still running (and many entires in my_user_app),
Enter; "curl localhost:8080/" to see a dynamicly generated webpage displaying
the FirstName, LastName, Age, and Email of every entry/row currently in my_user_app
